- Definition 5: The sequential reachability should be defined formally. When we have reach(ls_1):: â€¦::reach(ls_n) does it mean that the state ls_n is also reachable when ls_1 is reachable? 

- Proof of Theorem 3: Why "every local state in SLGC is mandatory to be reached"? Why perm (Ls)? The proof should be made more clear and also the assumptions under which the Theorem 3 holds.

- Section 4.3 should be made clearer. How the decision tree is constructed. How is it used to guide the search?

- Page 2, second column: The first and second sentences should be reformulated.
